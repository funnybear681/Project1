    <h3>Part 1: Preparation</h3>
    <p>For this assignment, I decided to observe my suite's microwave, as I have noticed that often times, it takes a few tries for people to use it correctly, including myself.</p>
    <h4>Sketch</h4>
    <img src="images/Sketch.png" alt="sketch" style="width: 40rem; height: 30rem;">
    <p>This interface is a microwave, which heats up food. Its key components are the numbers to type in how long the food should be cooked, the special settings for any specific foods, the open button, and the start button.</p>

</div>

<div id="Observations" class="container-fluid blankets color-gradients">
    <h3>Part 2: Observations</h3>
    <h4>Questions:</h4>
    <p>Was the interface intuitive to use?</p>
    <p>Were you able to accomplish your intended task on your first try?</p>
    <p>Was your task successful? i.e., did your food heat up to the correct degree?</p>
    <p>Were there any unintuitive parts that you chose to not use? (e.g., buttons you didn't know what they did, etc.)</p>
    <h2>Person 1</h2>
    <p>This person was microwaving leftover food from a dining hall, and they had no trouble opening the microwave. This person first tried to press 1, which started the microwave immediately on easy setting 1. They then pressed "Stop," suggesting they were not trying to use setting 1. They finally pressed the START (+30 seconds) button, and just took their food out after 15 seconds, then left to go sit at a table.</p>
    <h4>Question Answers: </h4>
    <p>The interface was not intuitive to use. They wanted to load 15 seconds, but could not type 15 without starting the microwave, so they just did the automatic 30 seconds and took out food early.</p>
    <p>It took them multiple tries to get 15 seconds on the microwave.</p>
    <p>They were not successful. The food was too hot; they were only microwaving a small portion of dessert, so 15 seconds proved to be too long.</p>
    <p>There were many unintuitive parts (most of the special settings like Baked Potato), and this person has never attempted to use them, just sticking with the more intuitive timed cook.</p>
    <h2>Person 2</h2>
    <p>This person used the microwave to put in popcorn. Again, no problems opening the microwave and putting food in. They pressed the "Popcorn"  button. They had a confused look at first, but eventually left their food in. They took out their popcorn, which appeared to be successfully popped, and walked back into their room.</p>
    <h4>Question Answers: </h4>
    <p>The interface was pretty intuitive, up until they pressed the popcorn button. They said a random number flashed on the screen, and they didn't know what it meant. Then, a timer started, and they figured they would just let it run, and it worked.</p>
    <p>They were able to pop their popcorn on the first go-around, but noted that there was still some degree of confusion.</p>
    <p>They were successful. The popcorn popped to a reasonable degree, with only a few unpopped kernels at the bottom, which they noted is normal.</p>
    <p>They said the interface is somewhat intuitive. Some of the unlabeled details (e.g., the number on the screen that flashed) were a little bit confusing, but not enough to impede the functionality.</p>
    <h2>Person 3</h2>
    <p>This person was also microwaving leftover food from a dining hall, but a much larger quanity; it appeared to be a full meal. Again, there was no confusion about opening the microwave. They simply pressed the START (+30 seconds) button twice, adding 1 minute to the timer, and they left their food in for the full minute. They took out their food, and again, went to sit at a table.</p>
    <h4>Question Answers: </h4>
    <p>They said the interface was intuitive. They knew their food would take about a minute to heat up, and the microwave makes it easy to load up any multiple of 30 seconds. They noted that multiples of 30 seconds are pretty much the only times they will load.</p>
    <p>It only took them one try to load up one minute.</p>
    <p>They said the food was successfully heated up, although it was unevenly heated, likely due to the internal function of the microwave; it does not spin, and there is no convection mechanism to heat evenly.</p>
    <p>They said the interface was very intuitive, although they noted that they had no idea how to use any of the special settings (buttons 1-6, or Popcorn, Baked Potato, etc.). However, they just avoid using them.</p>
